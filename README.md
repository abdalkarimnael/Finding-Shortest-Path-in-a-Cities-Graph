# Finding-Shortest-Path-in-a-Cities-Graph

This project, the fourth project of the DS course, implements Dijkstraâ€™s and Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms to find the shortest path between two cities using graph concepts. The data is read from the provided file cities.txt, and the program constructs the shortest path between a given source city (input from the user) and a destination city (also input from the user).

Usage
---
The menu options are as follows:

*Load cities: Loads the file and constructs the graph.

*Enter source: Reads the source city.

*Enter destination: Prints the full route of the shortest path including the distance between each two cities and the total shortest cost for both algorithms (Dijkstra and BFS).

*Exit: Prints the information of step 3 to a file called shortest_distance.txt and exits the program.
